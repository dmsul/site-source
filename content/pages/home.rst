I am an economist and research lead at the `JPMorgan Chase Institute
<jpmorganchaseinstitute.com>`_  where I lead teams studying student debt, consumer
responses to government stimulus, unemployment insurance, and other labor
market topics.

Prior to coming to the Institute, I was a research fellow at Resources for the
Future where I researched on air pollution policy and household responses to
air pollution.

I also maintain an econometrics and data utilities package for Python
called `Econtools <danielmsullivan.com/econtools>`_.
