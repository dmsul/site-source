I am economist and research director at the `JPMorgan Chase Institute
<jpmorganchaseinstitute.com>`_ where I lead research on topics in household finance,
including household financial resiliency, student debt, and the effects of
climate change on households.

Prior to joining the Insitute, he was a research fellow at Resources for the
Future where he studied the economic effects of pollution and environmental
gentrification.

I also maintain an econometrics and data utilities package for Python
called `Econtools <danielmsullivan.com/econtools>`_. 

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University and a bachelor's
degree in Mathematics and Economics from Brigham Young University.
