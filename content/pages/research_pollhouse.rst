**Abstract From Paper**

This paper presents evidence that current research significantly underestimates
the effects of air pollution. Conventional methods of measuring pollution
exposure cannot account for sharp changes in pollution over short distances or
the wind-driven dispersion of pollutants. I use a state-of-the-art atmospheric
dispersion model, which solves these problems, with a natural experiment to
estimate the causal effect of NOx exposure on house prices in metropolitan Los
Angeles. The wind-based estimates are over 10 times larger than conventional
estimates and imply that the net social benefit of RECLAIM, the local
cap-and-trade program underlying the natural experiment, is roughly $500
million per year.
